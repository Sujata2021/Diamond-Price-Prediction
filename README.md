## Machine Learning Project--Diamond Price Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the price of diamonds based on various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. The model is trained on the Diamonds dataset, which is a popular dataset for regression tasks in machine learning.

üìå Project Overview
Objective: Predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

ML Models Used: LinearRegression,Lasso,Ridge,Elasticnet,DecisionTree,Random Forest

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains over 1,93,574 diamonds with the following features:

carat: weight of the diamond (ranging from 0.2 to 3.5)

cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color: diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is

depth: total depth percentage

table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point

x: length in mm

y: width in mm

z: depth in mm

price: price in INR (target variable)

üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
Correlation matrix to check feature relationships

Visualizations for price distribution and feature importance

Handling of outliers and missing values

‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing
Label encoding of categorical features (cut, color, clarity)

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Train-test split (typically 80/20 or 70/30)
